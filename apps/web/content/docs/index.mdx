# First Steps

Shapeless helps you build fast, modern, fullstack apps with Next.js 15, Hono, and type-safe APIs—all optimized for Cloudflare Workers, Neon, and Drizzle ORM.

There are two ways to get started:

- Using the CLI (recommended)
- Manual setup (advanced)

If you used the CLI, everything is already set up. This guide walks through the core building blocks so you understand how your app works under the hood.

---

## 🗂️ Project Structure

Here’s the core file structure you'll see inside the `resources/` directory of a Shapeless project:

```bash
resources/
├── db/
│   └── schema.ts          # Drizzle schema
├── index.ts               # Main app router
├── routers/
│   └── post-router.ts     # Example router
├── shapeless.ts           # Framework + middleware setup
├── shared/
│   └── providers.tsx      # React Query provider
└── templates/
    └── post.tsx           # Sample UI or render component
```

---

## 1. Initialize Shapeless (`shapeless.ts`)

This file sets up your app context, environment, and database middleware. It's the foundation of your backend API.

```ts resources/shapeless.ts
import { neon } from "@neondatabase/serverless"
import { drizzle } from "drizzle-orm/neon-http"
import { env } from "hono/adapter"
import { shapeless } from "@shapelesss/core"

interface Env {
  Bindings: { DATABASE_URL: string }
}

export const j = shapeless.init<Env>()

export const databaseMiddleware = j.middleware(async ({ c, next }) => {
  const { DATABASE_URL } = env(c)
  const sql = neon(DATABASE_URL)
  const db = drizzle(sql)
  return await next({ db })
})

export const publicProcedure = j.procedure.use(databaseMiddleware)
```

Use `publicProcedure` to build any query/mutation with database access.

---

## 2. Create Your Router (`post-router.ts`)

Routers group related procedures. In this example, `postRouter` has two procedures: `recent` and `create`.

```ts resources/routers/post-router.ts
import { z } from "zod"
import { j, publicProcedure } from "../shapeless"

interface Post {
  id: number
  name: string
}

const posts: Post[] = [{ id: 1, name: "Hello World" }]

export const postRouter = j.router({
  recent: publicProcedure.query(({ c }) => {
    return c.superjson(posts.at(-1) ?? null)
  }),

  create: publicProcedure
    .input(z.object({ name: z.string().min(1) }))
    .mutation(({ c, input }) => {
      const post: Post = { id: posts.length + 1, name: input.name }
      posts.push(post)
      return c.superjson(post)
    }),
})
```

- `recent` returns the latest post
- `create` adds a new post with input validation via Zod

---

## 3. Set Up the App Router (`index.ts`)

This file merges all routers and applies global middleware like CORS and error handling.

```ts resources/index.ts
import { j } from "./shapeless"
import { postRouter } from "./routers/post-router"

const api = j
  .router()
  .basePath("/api")
  .use(j.defaults.cors)
  .onError(j.defaults.errorHandler)

const appRouter = j.mergeRouters(api, {
  post: postRouter,
})

export type AppRouter = typeof appRouter
export default appRouter
```

All routes inside `/api/post/*` will now be handled by `postRouter`.

---

## 4. React Query Setup (`providers.tsx`)

Shapeless encourages React Query for frontend API calls. Wrap your app with this provider:

```tsx resources/shared/providers.tsx
"use client"

import {
  QueryCache,
  QueryClient,
  QueryClientProvider,
} from "@tanstack/react-query"
import { HTTPException } from "hono/http-exception"
import { PropsWithChildren, useState } from "react"

export const Providers = ({ children }: PropsWithChildren) => {
  const [queryClient] = useState(
    () =>
      new QueryClient({
        queryCache: new QueryCache({
          onError: (err) => {
            if (err instanceof HTTPException) {
              // global error handling
            }
          },
        }),
      }),
  )

  return (
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>{children}</QueryClientProvider>
  )
}
```

---

## 5. Hook It Up in Next.js

To connect everything to your Next.js app, create a route handler at:

```ts app/api/[[...route]]/route.ts
import appRouter from "@/resources"
import { handle } from "hono/vercel"

export const GET = handle(appRouter.handler)
export const POST = handle(appRouter.handler)
```

For Cloudflare Workers, this setup is handled by `OpenNext`. Just build and deploy:

```bash
pnpm run cf:build
pnpm run cf:upload
```

---

## ✅ What’s Next

You're now ready to:

- Build more routers
- Define your Drizzle schema in `db/schema.ts`
- Deploy to Cloudflare with one command
- Make type-safe API calls using `fetch()` or React Query

Use this as your base, and expand however you want—admin studio, workflows, dashboard tools, auth systems—all built on this foundation.
