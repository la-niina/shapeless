# Performance

Shapeless is built on lightweight tools like Hono and Drizzle ORM to deliver high performance by default.

To further improve your app's performance, Shapeless supports **dynamic router and dependency loading** to reduce bundle sizes and speed up cold starts.

---

## Dynamically Loading Routers

Use the `dynamic()` helper to load routers only when needed. This keeps your initial bundle small and reduces cold start time:

```ts
// server/shapeless.ts
import { app, dynamic } from "@shapelesss/core"

const api = app
  .router()
  .basePath("/api")
  .use(app.defaults.cors)
  .onError(app.defaults.errorHandler)

const appRouter = app.mergeRouters(api, {
  users: dynamic(() => import("./routers/user-router")),
  posts: dynamic(() => import("./routers/post-router")),
})

export type AppRouter = typeof appRouter
export default appRouter
```

---

## Dynamic Imports Within Procedures

You can also do dynamic imports inside your procedure handlers to split code and defer loading of heavy dependencies until actually needed:

```ts
// server/routers/user-router.ts
import { app, publicProcedure } from "../shapeless"

export const userRouter = app.router({
  generateReport: publicProcedure.get(async ({ c }) => {
    // Dynamically import heavy utilities only when this route is called
    const { generatePDF } = await import("./utils/pdf-generator")
    const { processData } = await import("./utils/data-processor")

    const data = await processData(c.req.query())
    const pdf = await generatePDF(data)

    return c.json({ pdf })
  }),
})
```

This approach helps keep your server bundle lean and your app fast, especially as it grows.
