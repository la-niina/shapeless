# About Shapeless

**Shapeless is a modern web stack built around Next.js 15, Hono, and Cloudflare Workersâ€”focused on performance, flexibility, and full end-to-end type safety.**

Itâ€™s inspired by stacks like T3 and JStack but makes key architectural shifts to better support modern infrastructure, predictable DX, and optional complexity.

At its core, Shapeless uses:

- [**Next.js 15**](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-15) for the frontend and routing
- [**Hono ðŸ”¥**](https://hono.dev/) to handle lightweight backend logic using Web Standard APIs
- [**OpenNext**](https://open-next.js.org/) to run Next.js on Cloudflare Workers
- [**Drizzle ORM**](https://orm.drizzle.team/) for type-safe database access
- [**Zod**](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) for runtime validation

Letâ€™s walk through what makes Shapeless different and why I built it.

## Why I created Shapeless

I started building with stacks like T3 because they emphasized type safety, simplicity, and modern tooling. But the deeper I went, the more limitations showed upâ€”tightly coupled patterns, slow cold starts, limited backend control, and platform constraints.

**Shapeless came out of wanting more control, better performance, and cleaner separation of concerns.** Especially for edge-first apps, media-heavy platforms, and customizable deployments (like Cloudflare Workers or your own infra).

---

### 1. Built to Work with the Edge

Shapeless uses **OpenNext** to bring full Next.js 15 support to platforms like **Cloudflare Workers**, without extra glue or patches.

That means:

- Fast cold starts
- Native streaming
- Easy caching and routing
- And no lock-in to Vercel or Node

Want to self-host? Cloudflare? Railway? Fly.io? Shapeless gives you a build that runs anywhere with little to no modification.

---

### 2. Backend Without the Bloat

Instead of relying on heavy backend frameworks or abstractions, Shapeless uses **Hono**â€”a fast and composable Web API-compatible router. You can:

- Write full backend logic (like auth, uploads, dashboards) right inside your Next.js project
- Use `Response` objects directly
- Handle cookies, headers, sessions, and WebSockets without third-party wrappers

You're not tied to JSON APIs either. Want to return HTML, stream files, or SSR partials? You're free to.

---

### 3. Type Safety Without Lock-in

Shapeless doesn't enforce any state manager, RPC protocol, or client pattern.

Your backend routes are just standard Hono handlers. Your client is just `fetch()` (optionally wrapped with helpers). This gives you total freedom:

- Use React Query, Zustand, Jotaiâ€”or skip them
- Call APIs from React, outside React, or even from mobile apps
- Keep full type safety by sharing types across your monorepo (thanks to ESM + TS)

You get end-to-end type safety **without** locking into tRPC or other heavy abstractions.

---

### 4. Designed to Be Extendable

Shapeless isnâ€™t just a stackâ€”itâ€™s a foundation. With the CLI, you can scaffold full apps, backend routes, DB models, and even full CMS features.

Planned additions include:

- Visual schema designer (with React Flow)
- Plugin-based CLI system
- Auth providers (email, magic link, Google, GitHub, etc.)
- Admin studio with media manager, analytics, and table views
- Workflow support for larger apps and SaaS products

---

### 5. Cloudflare-First, But Not Cloudflare-Only

Shapeless runs natively on Cloudflare Workers, with support for caching, KV storage, R2, and edge streamingâ€”but also works perfectly on other platforms.

Youâ€™re not locked in. And you can bring your own infra.

---

## In Summary

Shapeless is for builders who want:

- Type-safe fullstack apps with modern tooling
- Fast, edge-first deployments
- Backend control without losing frontend speed
- Clean DX without framework lock-in

Itâ€™s lightweight where it should be, batteries-included where it matters, and modular enough to grow with you.

If that sounds like something you want to try, the CLI is ready:

```bash
pnpm dlx create-shapeless-app
```

Thanks for checking it out.
