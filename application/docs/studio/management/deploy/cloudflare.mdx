# Deploy to Cloudflare Workers

Shapeless can be deployed to Cloudflare Workers, giving you a globally distributed, serverless runtime for your API. This guide walks you through the deployment.

---

## Prerequisites

Everything is mostly setup and no need to actually set up much

1. Install the [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/):

```bash
npm install -g wrangler@latest
```

2. Have a Cloudflare account: [https://www.cloudflare.com/](https://www.cloudflare.com/)

---

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy via GitHub (recommended)

- Push your Shapeless project to GitHub.
- Set up a Cloudflare Pages project connected to your repo.
- Choose the **OpenNext** framework preset.
- Cloudflare Pages will build and deploy your app automatically on every push.

### 2. Deploy locally using provided scripts

You can also deploy manually using Shapeless’s helper scripts which handle OpenNext build and deployment:

```bash
pnpm cf:build    # Builds your app for Cloudflare Workers
pnpm cf:deploy   # Deploys the built app to Cloudflare Workers
```

These scripts wrap Wrangler but also run the Next.js build process required for OpenNext.

---

### Update your client

After deployment, update your API client to point to your deployed Worker URL:

```ts
// @/shapeless.client.ts
import type { AppRouter } from "@/resources/index"
import { createClient } from "shapeless"

export const client = createClient<AppRouter>({
  baseUrl: `${getBaseUrl()}/api`,
})

function getBaseUrl() {
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "production") {
    return "https://<YOUR_DEPLOYMENT>.workers.dev"
  }
  return "http://localhost:8787"
}
```

---

## Environment Variables

Add environment variables to your Worker using Wrangler:

```bash
wrangler secret put <KEY>
```

For bulk updates, see [Wrangler secret bulk commands](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/#secretbulk).

---

## Common Issues

### CORS Configuration

If you experience CORS problems, verify your Worker is configured with CORS middleware correctly:

```ts
// resources/index.ts
import { app } from "./shapeless"
import { postRouter } from "./routers/post-router"

const api = app
  .router()
  .basePath("/api")
  .use(app.defaults.cors)
  .onError(app.defaults.errorHandler)

const appRouter = app.mergeRouters(api, {
  post: postRouter,
})

export type AppRouter = typeof appRouter

export default appRouter
```
