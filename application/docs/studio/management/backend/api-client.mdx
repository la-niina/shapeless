# Type-Safe API Client

Shapeless provides an **end-to-end type-safe API client** that knows your entire backend router. This means TypeScript can infer exactly what your API expects and returns, helping you catch errors early.

---

## 1. Client Setup

Create your API client by passing it the `AppRouter` type from your backend. Adjust the base URL depending on your deployment environment:

```ts src/app/shapeless-client.ts
import { createClient } from "@shapelesss/core"
import type { AppRouter } from "@/server"

export const client = createClient<AppRouter>({
  baseUrl: getBaseUrl() + "/api",
})

function getBaseUrl() {
  if (process.env.VERCEL_URL) return `https://${process.env.VERCEL_URL}`
  return "http://localhost:3000"
}
```

---

## 2. Making API Calls

Use the client anywhere in your app with full type safety. Here’s a simple example calling a `post.recent` endpoint:

```ts
import { client } from "@/shapeless-client"

const res = await client.post.recent.$get()
const post = await res.json()
// TypeScript infers the exact response shape here
```

---

## 3. Using with React Query

Because the client is just a typed `fetch` wrapper, you can use it with **any** state management or data fetching library. For example, with React Query:

```tsx
"use client"

import { client } from "@/shapeless-client"
import { useQuery } from "@tanstack/react-query"

export default function Page() {
  const { data, isLoading } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ["post-recent"],
    queryFn: async () => {
      const res = await client.post.recent.$get()
      return await res.json()
    },
  })

  if (isLoading) return <p>Loading...</p>

  return <h1>{data.title}</h1>
}
```

You can swap React Query for Zustand, Jotai, Redux, or anything else — it just works.

This type-safe client keeps your frontend and backend tightly integrated, reducing bugs and improving DX.
