# Key Features of Shapeless

Shapeless is a fullstack framework designed to build fast, type-safe apps with modern deployment in mind. It‚Äôs not just a starter‚Äîit‚Äôs a production-ready base that works across platforms, especially at the edge.

---

## 1. ‚ö° Fast and Lightweight by Default

Shapeless is built on [**Hono**](https://hono.dev/) using its ultra-lightweight `RegExpRouter`. For database access, we use [**Drizzle ORM**](https://orm.drizzle.team/)‚Äîwhich avoids the heavy query engines and bloat seen in ORMs like Prisma.

This combination ensures fast cold starts, smaller bundles, and predictable runtime behavior‚Äîeven when deployed globally.

With our `cf:build` + `cf:upload` scripts, you can bundle and deploy your app to Cloudflare Workers in seconds:

```bash
pnpm run cf:build && pnpm run cf:upload
```

No Docker, no VMs‚Äîjust instant edge deployment.

---

## 2. üîí End-to-End Type Safety (Without the Lock-In)

Shapeless brings full type safety from API to frontend‚Äîbut doesn‚Äôt force you into specific patterns like React Query or tRPC.

Our client system is simple, fetch-based, and type-safe:

```ts
const res = await client.media.getRecent.$get()
const { media } = await res.json()
// ^ media is fully typed
```

You‚Äôre free to use **Zustand**, **React Query**, **TanStack Router**, or even plain fetch logic‚Äîwithout sacrificing DX.

We auto-generate the client for you, keeping backend and frontend in sync, and letting you drop it into any state management approach.

---

## 3. üåê Edge-First Cloudflare Support

Shapeless integrates tightly with **Cloudflare Workers** and **OpenNext**, offering first-class support for edge deployments.

Our CLI and scripts let you:

- Build for Cloudflare using `cf:build`
- Deploy static assets and server handlers via `cf:upload`
- Generate Cloudflare env types with `cf:gen`
- Apply Drizzle DB migrations locally or remotely
- Preview your full Next.js app with `cf:preview`

Example scripts from `package.json`:

```json
"cf:build": "opennextjs-cloudflare build",
"cf:upload": "opennextjs-cloudflare build && opennextjs-cloudflare upload",
"cf:gen": "wrangler types --env-interface CloudflareEnv cloudflare-env.d.ts"
```

And from `wrangler.jsonc`:

```jsonc
{
  "main": ".open-next/worker.js",
  "assets": {
    "directory": ".open-next/assets",
    "binding": "ASSETS",
  },
  "d1_databases": [
    {
      "binding": "DB",
      "database_name": "replacewithyourown",
    },
  ],
  "r2_buckets": [
    {
      "bucket_name": "replacewithyourown",
      "binding": "R2",
    },
  ],
}
```

Shapeless is designed to **run anywhere**, but shines on Cloudflare‚Äôs global edge network.

---

## 4. üí∞ Cost-Efficient by Design

Cloudflare Workers give you **100,000 free requests per day**‚Äîno credit card required.

Combined with R2 (S3-compatible object storage) and D1 (SQLite-compatible serverless DB), you can run serious fullstack apps with:

- Near-zero cost at small scale
- Sub-second response times globally
- Full control over data and compute

No need to pay Vercel for every route. No background processes or cold starts to worry about. And yes‚Äî**you can self-host too**.

---

## 5. üß± Modular and Extendable

Shapeless is structured as a set of internal modules and CLI generators. Over time, we plan to include:

- Admin studio and dashboard tooling
- Visual schema editor using React Flow
- Auth plugins (magic link, OAuth, 2FA)
- OpenAPI generation
- CLI commands to scaffold routes, schemas, workflows, and entire CMS blocks

It‚Äôs not just a template‚Äîit‚Äôs an app system you can evolve, remix, and scale.

---

## Final Note

We‚Äôre building Shapeless for the real-world cases we run into‚Äîedge apps, streaming platforms, dashboards, headless CMS tools, and everything in between.

Try it out with:

```bash
pnpm dlx create-shapeless-app
```

Or deploy to Cloudflare right away:

```bash
pnpm run cf:upload
```
