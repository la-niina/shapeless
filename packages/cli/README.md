# Shapeless CLI – Create a New Shapeless App

A simple CLI for scaffolding new Shapeless apps, inspired by the [T3 Stack CLI](https://create.t3.gg/).

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

Run one of the following commands:

```bash
pnpm dlx create-shapeless-app
```

```bash
bunx create-shapeless-app
```

```bash
npm create shapeless-app@latest
```

```bash
yarn create shapeless-app
```

This will launch the CLI, and you'll be prompted to choose:

- <input type="checkbox" checked /> your project name
- <input type="checkbox" checked/> where to install it
* <input type="checkbox" checked /> which template or stack to use
* <input type="checkbox" disabled /> any optional features (e.g. auth, CMS, storage, etc.)


## 🧠 Credits

This CLI is heavily inspired by the excellent  [Jstack](https://jstack.app/) taken from [create-t3-app](https://create.t3.gg/) CLI.
Big thanks to the T3 team for their architecture and DX inspiration.
